## Concept

Environment Driven Assets is a FabricMC mod that allows to load [env.json](https://modrinth.com/mod/env.json) files in order
to redirect Minecraft Vanilla Asset Types based on the environment context.

Environment Driven Assets loads in a complete client-sided environment, which allows users to play on their favorite servers
with it.

## Development Status

Environment Driven Assets is highly Work-In-Progress! A lot of features are not currently implemented.

Currently, the mod only allows to redirect Block Models (json) and Item Models (json).

Next features like BlockState redirections or Texture redirections are under development.

## Usage For Resource Pack Creators

You will have to look at [the env.json wiki](https://github.com/MModding/env.json?tab=readme-ov-file#the-envjson-format).
Note that Environment Driven Assets currently only loads [env.json](https://modrinth.com/mod/env.json) files present under the
`<namespace>/models/block` asset directory and the `<namespace>/models/item` directory.
